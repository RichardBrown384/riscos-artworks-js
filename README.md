# riscos-artworks-js

Javascript library and file format [documentation](docs/FileFormat.md) for Computer Concepts era 
RISC OS [Artworks][artworks-wikipedia] files.

## Installation

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/RichardBrown384/riscos-artworks-js.git
```

## Project status

Large parts of the file format aren't well understood. Therefore, the library and documentation are offered
as works in progress and there isn't much emphasis on the software engineering fundamentals
such as testing.

A work-in-progress online viewer is hosted [here](http://richardbrown384.github.io/riscos-artworks-react).
